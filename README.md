# Hideaway

## Abstract
I was tasked with building a website with two users in mind——the manager and the client. The client is able to browse available rooms (and book a room) for a given date, see their bookings and see money spent on past and future bookings. The manager is able to log in and see total revenue for a given day, percent occupany and rooms available for the current date. They can also book a room for a client or delete a booking if necessary.

We weren't given a spec, only user stories, so I had fun designing this one!
